# A Note in dradis is the basic unit of information. It has a :text and an
# :author field that capture the contents of the Note and the creator.
#
# In Dradis 2.x notes have a fixed set of fields (:text, :author, :category,
# :node). However, it is expected that in Dradis 3.x it will be possible to
# configure this list of fields to match the needs of the users.
#
# In the interim, Dradis 2.x Note objects use a special syntax in their :text
# field to define different fields. This syntax is as follows:
#
#   #[Title]#
#   Directory Listings
#
#   #[Description]#
#   Some directories on the server were configured [...]
#
# The syntax above would result in the call to the fields method to return a
# Hash with two elements:
#
#   {
#     'Title' => 'Directory Listings',
#     'Description' => 'Some directories on the server were configured [...]',
#   }
#
#
# This behaviour is extensively used by import/export plugins such as WordExport.
